Nodes represent a device that controls devices. It is generally a computer, such as a Raspberry Pi
or Arduino. It can also be a Windows 10 desktop that sends commands to a Raspberry Pi that controls
a string of lights, or series of servos. As such, a node can be connected to other nodes via network. 
See \ref network_interface_design for more information.
